# Bookshelves

I started this project in order to teach myself Angular 2, Typescript, and Bootstrap 4. The design is entirely hand-coded to be responsive using Bootstrap 4. The content (list of books on the home page) is dynamically pulled from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) using the [Content Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/). My goal for this project was to use Angular 2 best-practices to develop a clean, beautiful, and database-free web application.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.
